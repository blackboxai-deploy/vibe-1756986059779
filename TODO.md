# Hello World Page Implementation

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Create main Hello World page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- [x] Implement modern gradient styling with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Add responsive layout and typography
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [x] Build the application (`pnpm run build --no-lint`)
- [x] Start the server (`pnpm start`)
- [x] Test the page functionality
- [x] Verify responsive design

## Status
✅ **Completed** - Hello World page successfully created and deployed
